## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the detection and prediction of rice leaf diseases. Rice is one of the most important staple crops globally, and its health is crucial for food security. Detecting diseases in rice leaves early can help farmers take timely action to protect their crops, leading to increased yields and reduced losses.

The RiceLeaf-disease Prediction project leverages machine learning techniques to identify common rice leaf diseases, such as Bacterial leaf blight, Brown Spot, and Leaf smut, from images. By training a model on a diverse dataset of rice leaf images, we aim to provide a tool that can assist farmers and researchers in diagnosing these diseases quickly and accurately.

## Features

- **Disease Detection**: The model can identify various rice leaf diseases, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment.
- **User-friendly Interface**: We provide an easy-to-use interface for uploading images and receiving disease predictions.
- **Accuracy**: The model is trained on a large dataset to ensure high accuracy in disease detection.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on how to use the model and contribute to the project is available.

## Getting Started

To get started with the RiceLeaf-disease Prediction project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stselvan2511/RiceLeaf-disease-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the web interface for disease prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in this repo. It contains a diverse collection of rice leaf images with annotations for different diseases.
